## User Experience

This App was created on the wordpress CMS. The theme is custom made. It selects cities, gets the temperatures and then challenges users to determine which of 4 cities currently is that warm. After the selection is made the user is informed whether his/her selection is correct/incorrect and the temperatures of all four cities is provided.
